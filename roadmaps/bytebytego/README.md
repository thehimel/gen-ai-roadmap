Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content based on what it has learned from existing knowledge. It has the potential to revolutionize human learning.

Here’s a GenAI roadmap with learning resources:
1. Learn about important concepts like Probability, Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra.
2. Understand the working of foundational models like GPT, MetaAI’s Llama, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Claude.
3. Learn the GenAI development stack that includes Python, Language, ChatGPT APIs, Prompt Engineering, VectorDB, DeepSeek, Llama, and Huggingface.
4. Learn how to train and fine-tune a foundation model.
5. Understand the role of AI Agents and how to build one using GenAI tools.
6. Learn about GenAI models for computer vision such as GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), MidJourney, DALL E, Flux, and so on.
7. Make use of GenAI Learning Resources such as DeepLearning AI platform, Kaggle, Generative AI Insider’s Guide by ByteByteGo, Google Labs, and Nvidia Learning platforms.
